🚀 Just Launched: **Interview Tracker for Job Seekers**  
🧠 A personal side project built to organize the chaos of job applications

---

🎯 **Why I Built This**  
As someone who's actively exploring product management and interviewing, I realized how scattered job applications can become — LinkedIn, referrals, career sites, etc.  
So I built a lightweight **Interview Tracker** that helps users:

✅ Log job applications  
✅ Track status (Applied → Interviewing → Offer)  
✅ Set follow-up reminders  
✅ Analyze platforms that actually convert

---

📦 **What I Practiced**  
This project helped me apply real product thinking:

- Defined a clear product vision & user personas  
- Wrote user stories based on real pain points  
- Created wireframes using Excalidraw  
- Designed an MVP roadmap  
- Managed everything via GitHub (Issues, Projects, Docs)

🧱 Tech: [React / Glide / Google Sheets] (Choose what you used)
