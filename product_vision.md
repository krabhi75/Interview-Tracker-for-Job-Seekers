# 🎯 Product Vision – Interview Tracker for Job Seekers

---

## 📝 Project Name:
**Interview Tracker**

---

## 🌟 Vision Statement:

> “Help job seekers stay organized, motivated, and informed by tracking their job applications and interviews — all in one clean, user-friendly platform.”

---

## 🧩 Problem We’re Solving:

Job seekers often apply to many roles across different platforms (LinkedIn, company websites, referrals, etc.). This creates challenges like:
- Losing track of which jobs they applied to
- Forgetting follow-up dates
- Not knowing which platforms yield results
- Reapplying to the same job unknowingly

---

## 👥 Target Users:

- Final-year students applying for internships or jobs  
- Experienced professionals actively job hunting  
- Career coaches helping their clients  
- PMs and developers creating their job-hunting dashboard

---

## 🧠 Goals:

- Centralize job application records
- Track progress (Applied → Interview → Offer/Rejected)
- Help with follow-ups & reminders
- Visualize trends (where are offers coming from?)

---
